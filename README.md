# 3DCL
3D City and Landscape plugin for Rhino 

This Rhino Plugin is designed to support landscape modeling using geographic information in Rhino. It was first created to support the 3D City and Landscape Course taught at the Rhode Island School of Design. 

Installation instructions can be found at: https://vimeo.com/360047570 (Please follow these instructions!)

Instructional videos (command by command) can be found at: vimeo.com/showcase/3dcl

Additional video tutorials with guidance (including the above) can be found www.peterstempel.com/tutorials

These files are continually being updated based on needs of students. Given the disparate time at which different commands were developed some inconsistencies are in the code. The plugin is provided nonetheless and students are encouraged to use and cabibalize these materials. Updates will be periodically posted as they become available. 

Cheers,
Peter
